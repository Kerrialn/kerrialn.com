        "I'm tired of some assumptions made by developers (juniour and senior). This issue effects large and small alike. For example, the assumption that if you are in a certain location then you will want to have the application in the local language. Why make this assumption? For what benifit? are you expecting everyone who lives, travels through and visits to speak the local language?",

For what benifit? are you expecting everyone who lives, travels through and visits to speak the local language?",
        "The objective may possibly be to save the user time, but if you inverse that arguement and think about how many people have been inconvenienced, by having to hunt around in the application settings attempting to change the language back to the language they previously selected. My point here is why not just let the user choose? If they want to change language they will.",
        "This issue appears to be rather trivial initally. so what? If you go to different countires you are greeted in different languages so why not digitally as well, or you might just say who cares, stop being lazy and just change the language.",
        "Well the deeper issue is based on two reasons,  firstly developers do these types of things purely because they can and the inherint assumption that whatever is newer must be better. That to me is an issue.",
        "Unless there is an ulterior motive, such as wanting your customers to have perticular settings, (such as privicy) then make changing those settings so painfully frustrating then almost no user would try it. This can be seen with Apple's Icloud, if this is not intentionally atempting to deter the user from turning it off then there is something very very wrong.",
        "The same sort of thing can be seen on Facebook, when was the last time your checked your privicy settings? It seems the website is actively trying to distract it's customers from changing their settings.",
        "personally I think over time, frustation with over advertising, overly confusing application processes and layouts, will give rise to a simplify movemnt, that will either reject techonology all together, such as anti-wifi cafes where non-tech activities would be promoted and/or applications that are the simplist and easiest to use, configure and modify or merely appear to be so, will become king of the digial mound of data dirt.",

        "It seems to me that the wave of free usage platforms with an advert based profit model, has done far more harm than good.

        "It seems to me that the wave of free usage platforms with an advert based profit model, has done far more harm than good. Look at the nearly endless array of awesome and powerful, free tools that we have at our disposal as developers today from github to analytics tools, netlify to cloudflare.",
        "Even if you look at the free stuff available if you're not a developer. Facebook, Google (most products), Coursera, Wix, 1 month free subscriptions for a plethora of services. ",
        "All these free tools have done is devalue programming in general and raise barriers to entry into the online marketplace. ",
        "Devaluation has occurred because we have been given so many programeticlly very complex tools for free, therefore complex functionality has become automatically expected by customers, furthermore for free. Even though it may have taken teams of developers many hours to build said functionality. This naturally raises barriers to entry, because smaller tech companies can not afford to hire enough programmers to compete effectively.",
        "Essentially, the advert based business models have won hands down. But at what price? Well put it like this advertising is very lucrative, but so are data sets, maybe more so.",
        "Currently users data is the digital currency of the day, the value of data changes based on it type and it’s verifiability. (*Forbes - How Much Is Your Data Worth?) For example knowing a customer's address and having that information verified by a government issued document would make that user's data far more valuable, than just knowing an email address that isn’t verified at all, I think for obvious reasons.  ",
        "To me the next gold mine is opinion mining, seeing as most economies are built on confidence of the consumer and investors, then knowing customers opinions of your products would be extremely valuable, apply these option data sets to AI pattern recognition algorithms and boom you might have percentage of predictability in public reception or even consumption of a new product. This is just the tip of the iceberg and it’s happening now. ",
        "The future is one of big data and pattern finding AI, all in an attempt to predict consumer behaviour and reduce company risk. It’ll be good, high quality, cheap or free. Until the accuracy of AI prediction becomes guaranteeable and new data is no longer needed. Then what? ",
