                    <p>Words, interpretation of meaning, filtered through our bias and experience, implied or explicit statements. Now a days
we spend so much time reading between the lines of what is being said, that the actual meaning is mostly lost. My
generation seem more focused on how things are said rather then what is being said. How an experience makes them feel is
of greater importance than the outcome. If we analysis for even a moment we can see this to be true, most negativity is
brushed off as ‘being a hater’ so now naturally the question becomes, well how did this happen? Some smart cunt said
“The Parents fight for freedom, the children forget and the grand children pay the price” this rings very true in my
mind and I believe that history is repeating itself yet again.</p>
<p>We have become desensitized to language. Did you even notice the word “cunt” in the previous paragraph? The fact that
potential constructive criticism could ever be defined as “hating” is absurd.</p>
<p>Think about World war II or just think about war in general. Not a game, real warfare. I have never been in a war, but I
think our collective imaginations will suffice. Bombs that destroy grown men to a mist of blood, explosions so powerful
the ground feels like water. Bullets tearing through any flesh they come into contact with. Men, women, children,
annihilated in to bit of body, scattered over the ground covered in dirt and blood. The whimpering of the afraid and
injured fill the air.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable? And here is my point, if we use words to describe things that have no relation, we devalue the meaning of
the actual word. A person talking to you being critical, is objectively not a hater. A hater is a person who hates. Hate
is define as “intense dislike”. I really hope you have never had an intense dislike for anyone. Most of my generation
have never experienced the words they so commonly use and I believe this is why we have some many issues with
communication.</p>
<p>Using offensive words might make someone rude or ignorant, but it’s only until they act upon their words and beliefs in
a violent manner does it make them something more. Let us all take a bit more responsibility for our words and the
objective meaning they have.</p>
